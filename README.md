# RPS
A Rock Paper Scissors engine designed to run two algoritms against each other

#Inspiration
Inspired and heavily influenced by Free Code Camp's version, I attempted to replicate it in order to help myself learn how it functions

#Challenges Welcome
I will be updating player_1 but feel free to submit a pull request for player_2 and I will do my best to meet your challenge, and let me know how your algorithm fared against mine!
